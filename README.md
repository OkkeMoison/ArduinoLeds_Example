# ArduinoLeds Example
This file is used to direct an Arduino with a LED-stip of 30 lights and a 4x1 matrix button.
While running "chill" or "party" mode (button 2 or 3), the mode will switch randomly between the sub-modes shown below.
This switch will happen randomly between 1 and 10 minutes.

Button 1: Moving rainbow

Button 2: "Chill" mode: 
  - Bouncing lights
  - Moving rainbow
  - Lights moving from one side to the other
  - Bouncing lights from the middle 

Button 3: "Party" mode:
  - Random colours
  - Moving rainbow (faster than "chill")
  - Lights moving from one side to the other (faster than "chill")
  - Bouncing lights (faster than "chill")
  - Bouncing lights from the middle (faster than "chill")

Button 4: Fixed white light

Below is a short video that shows the use of the buttons.
