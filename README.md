# ArduinoLeds_Example
This file is used to direct an Arduino with a LED-stip of 30 lights and a 4x1 matrix button.
While running "chill" or "party" mode (button 2 or 3), the mode will switch randomly between the sub-modes shown below.
This switch will happen randomly 
between 1 and 10 minutes.

  - Moving rainbow (faster than "chill")
  - Lights moving from one side to the other (faster than "chill")
